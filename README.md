# InVisible Weather
### When you can't see the weather, and yet you can.

## Before You Begin
```
yarn
```

If you don't have `yarn` (you should be ashamed of yourself then ;-)):

```
npm install
```

## Running
```
yarn start
```
If you don't have `yarn` then I am not going to help you here, just kidding:
```
npm run start
```

## Testing
```
yarn test
```
Now I really not going to help you with `npm`.

## Building
```
yarn build
```

## Linting
```
yarn lint
```

## Issues?
I don't care, I am not going to maintain this repo ;-)
